    		<li>What are the 'top selling' app categories in the U.S.?</li>
    		<p>The top selling apps in the United States are games, with Apple devices, and Android devices. The next categories are utility apps, social media, and productivity.</p>
    		<li>What are the 'top selling' app categories in Japan?</li>
    		<p>In Japan are also games, but are followed by productivity apps, such as book apps, and photo and video editing apps.</p>
    		<li>What are the 'top selling' app categories in Great Britain?</li>
    		<p>Great Britain is also games, and followed by music apps, and social media.</p>
    	<li>Based on your three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed?</li>
    	<p>From the information gathered of the top app category is that games are the best selling, and downloaded right now and draws a lot of developers to make these types of apps. Social media apps will always draw attention for a period of time, once the apps are downloaded the only thing to do with social media is to update. Utility apps would work in all three markets, because almost everyone links their emails, and uses maps. Photo editing is popular right now because of apps such as Instagram allowing people to slightly modify pictures and share them on Facebook, and Twitter. </p>
    	<li>What percentage of Android users have the latest/greatest OS in the U.S? in Japan? in Great Britain? How might these differences impact development?</li>
    	<p>The percentage of smartphones with the Android OS in the United States is 47%. In Japan it increase to 60% and rounds off at 36.6% for the United Kingdom. The Android site lists the latest OS as Jelly Bean and it has a 0.8% penetration because its only available on certain Android devices. The greatest OS in rotation right now is Gingerbread still, and it holds a 60.3% of Android systems. These rates impact the development cycle because we as developers can utilize this data to target regions best for deploying Android apps.</p>
    	<li>What is the average cost and bandwidth limits per user (in general) in each of the three markets? How may this impact development?</li>
    	<p>In Japan the number of users with unlimited data plans far surpasses the US and UK, with 75% of users. Very few companies now days have the option for unlimited data plans, which give users more awareness of how much data, and bandwidth they will be using. The average cost in the US is about $50 for 5GB, the cost in the UK is a little lower. This could impact certain markets because society is so money conscience that instead of continuing to download what you want, users will be more aware of the amount of data they will be using and may pass on certain apps because of that. The best way to work around that will be by figuring out how to make a large app without using so much data.</p>
    	<li>And, finally, what would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice? Feel free to have a first and second choice.</li>
    	<p>Based on the statistics, the best category to develop for is games. Being completely honest Iâ€™m not a gamer what so ever, so hopefully once we get to those classes I will get a better liking to the gaming side. But I would probably get into the productivity side, being able to make users lives easier seems to be what is most wanted. Of course if someone was able to come up with the next best social network, any app that would make it usable on a device will create a lot of buzz around it. </p>
