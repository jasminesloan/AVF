      <h1>Week 3: Accessibility</h1>
    </section>
    
    	<ol>
    		<li>What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible? (Remember, you can use the Section tag with jQuery, for instance)</li>
    		<p>When we first began coding in the program, I used the simple HTML tags we learned and were given to us to use. As time went on and we began using jQuery I assumed after that was the easiest way to code. To me personally I thought it made the app look cleaner and user-friendly. But since entering AVF we’ve reverted back to HTML, and I believe that while we are doing the coding the different tags are easier for us to read. I didn’t use the section tags as much but by sectioning things off the user knows exactly where in the app to look for specific items. I’ve never used the ALT tags or anything outside of the basic tags provided. For hearing impaired my app isn’t very accessible at all. My crud however is a music app so in a sense that would be pretty user-friendly, but in order to get to the actual music there are a few ins and outs that wouldn’t be to friendly for non-hearing users. Now I think it would be better to go through the checklist to see how to make my app, and future apps, as accessible to others as possible. Because I know sometimes we in our minds may think it’s easy because of the vision we have, and in turn it’s very difficult with a lot of useless things.</p>
    		<li>Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?</li>
    		<p>While watching the video about JAWS, the first thing I noticed that was frustrating was the counting percentage of the page loading, it seemed extremely slow for a user with visual impairments. But right after I hear that there are 277 links, and the mouse was on 17, but how will the user know exactly which one they are on and if its what they need? There for the link tags could possible be named differently in order to better serve the users. I do however like the keyboards that are directly on the screen making it easier for the users to hear what they are touching in particular.</p>
    		<li>Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility. </li>
    		<p>With both Android and iOS, they give you a voice control feature, I personally used it once just to see what it is about but always refer to typing instead. Digit dialing and dial by name give users the options for you to speak the number and the phone will dial it or having the name called and dialing the phone number that way. They also have a menu readout that will give you options to call out different commands, email, texts, notes alarms, etc. pretty much any app can be programmed to be accessed with the menu readout.</p>
    	<li>Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</li>
    	<p>The most obvious for iOS is Siri, I don’t like Siri, but some love it, but Siri gives users full accessibility to all users and control over the entire device. Giving commands Siri will set reminders look information on the Internet, etc. Android provides a TalkBack app with Braille display giving blind and visually impaired users the feature of hearing the displayed braille being able to input the words into devices.</p>
