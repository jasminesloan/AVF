    		<li>What types of native features (on Android and iOS devices) would you be able to implement with the use of HTML/CSS/JS only?</li>
    		<p>While doing research on native features I saw in one situation where you can use geolocation with HTML5, where the JavaScript will support the locations, active and inactive. You can put native features into an app using HTML, JS, and CSS, but in order for them to function properly other third party applications are needed.</p>
    		<li>What types of features do you think will pair well together in an app?</li>
    		<p>With my app in particular, since it is a music-based app I will probably want to put three native features for different reasoning’s. The Alert feature because anytime the music is updated I want to send out an alert to notify the users there is new music. I wouldn’t want them to have to open the app on order for them to know; to me it makes it a little more interactive that way. The camera feature because you will have to set up a profile, I don’t know yet how interactive I will make it with other users, but instead of just a name you can add your face. Also, the geolocation, there is already a place within the app to submit your zip code, By doing this it allows me to see what areas we’re reaching and in what locations the app is being used, it would be cool if there was a map instead of just your basic typed zip code.</p>
    		<li>Please describe any design and functionality intentions you may have for your Demo app components this month.</li>
    		<p>This month I want to try to make my app more user-friendly and likeable, I want to tweak some of the designing in CSS to make it more unique, and not so formatted to jQuery. I think I started to get comfortable with jQuery but its very plain, and simple, which is not my style what so ever, but also by doing some of things, I am hoping to produce more ideas for different apps in the future. </p>
    	<li>Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.</li>
    	<p>The main lesson learned in the past was Robin in MiU, because my original app is so detailed, it would make more sense to pull a lot of the data from online sources, which is being worked on now. But also a lot of user-friendly details that needs to be worked out, for example, am I going to allow users to download and take up the data, or stream. Also, the biggest lesson was about keeping things as simple as possible so users won’t be so overwhelmed with a lot at once.</p>
